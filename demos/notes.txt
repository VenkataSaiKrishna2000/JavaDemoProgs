operators?
    UNARY OPEARATOR:
               a=10;
               a++;
               a--;
               ++a;
               --a;
    binary OPERATOR
               (a=10,b=20;)
                a<b;
                a>b;
                a>=b;
                a<=b;

                a==10 && b==20;
                a==10 || b==20;
                Relational oprators
                     <=,>=,==,!=
                Logical opearators:&&,||,!
                Assignment Operators:=
                Arithematic Operators:+,*,-,/,%
    Ternary operator:a=2,b=5;
                      (a<=5)?a:b;

ineritance ?
 acquring the propertis from pparent to child
 advantage ?
        code re use
        reduce the  length of code
        our application performance will fast  
   
types of inheritance:
single level inheritance:1 parent and 1 child
multi level inheritance:1 parent 1 child and 1 grand child and so on
multiple inheritance:1 child 2 parents
hierarchial inheritance:1 parent 2 or more child
hybrid inheritance : combination of both hieararchial and multiple inheritances

class name : Capital
mtthod : small 
var : starts with char+ follwed by  number
